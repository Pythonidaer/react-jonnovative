## Future Improvements
I watched a great React-Router-Dom tutorial by Dev Ed and saw how you can loop over a key value by using an item from within a fetched object. Using that unique id, you can create a Link component that dynamically renders pages. This would come in handy if I wanted to have one page for general project information, with a link within each project dynamically rendering to another page with more information. For this homework, I am settling on just mapping over json projects into one page.

In my last portfolio rendition, I was finally able to utilize Intersection Observer. However, this time around I was in a bind for time and didn't want to get stuck on figuring out Intersection Observer with React syntax. I definitely want to add this over my summer, as it makes no sense to lose skills and features with the addition of new technologies that are supposed to make development easier and more performant.

The homework assignment advised to try using animations and react component libraries. I sort of shipped this one with a react-bootstrap component library. In the future I want to recreate this with Bulma, clean it up, possibly add a lot more custom CSS (or find a different component library such as Material-UI) and truly making this the best portfolio I have ever created. Right now, this was less my most up to date portfolio and more my last homework assignment.

In general, I simply want to make this look good. I am far more committed with limited time to delivering an amazing Project 3. I did what I could with the time that I had for this homework. It's a proof of concept. If anybody doubts my styling abilities, they need only look at the April portfolio that I didn't have time to completely recreate.
